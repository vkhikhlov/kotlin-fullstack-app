# kotlin-fullstack-app

This repo contains my experiments with kotlin. Also aim of this project is to play with [ktor](https://ktor.io/) 
framework and to determine design of [kotlin-vue-wrappers](https://github.com/vkhikhlov/kotlin-vue-wrappers) 
which contain wrappers for [Vue](https://vuejs.org) library.
